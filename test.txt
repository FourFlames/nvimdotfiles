{
    "name/of-thingy",
    event = "SomethingLazy",
    config = function()
        require("of-thingy").setup({
            --config
        }),
        Worth noting that other options can be included here,
            especially in the case of older plugins.
        For example, in our auto-pairs plugin, we set
            vim.g.SomeSettingIForgetTheNameOf = 1, (aka true),
    end
}

Oh, that's actually way the fuck more readable now
Nice.
